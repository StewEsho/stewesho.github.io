+ Rhythm-based "platformer" where you don't play as the platforming character. Rather, you're a guardian angel protecting a pizza delivery guy as he hops through the streets of Toronto
+ Developed in Unity, and avaiable to play on web!
+ Created by team of 10 as a course project for CSC404 (Winter 2022) at the University of Toronto
